# Hi, I'm Riccardo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Riccardo, a 16-year-old developer and high school student. In my free time, I enjoy turning needs into software solutions. My passion is creating applications that make life easier, one project at a time.

## Skills

I'm primarily a front-end developer, specializing in Flutter to create intuitive, cross-platform user interfaces. I have a decent foundation in Python, which I use to prototype complex features before implementing them in Dart for my applications. For database management and authentication, I prefer Supabase. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to sharpen my skills in the world of front-end and mobile development.

## Projects

* **My.Bookshelf (Flutter/Dart):** An application to manage your personal bookshelf. It allows you to catalog your books, keep track of which ones you've read and which ones you still have to read: find out more [here](https://github.com/riccardodebellini/mybookshelf)!
* **FantaProf (In development, Flutter/Dart):** An app where you can "buy" your favorite teachers and climb the class ranking based on their actions. A fun way to gamify school life! Follow the development of this project [here](https://github.com/riccardodebellini/mybookshelf).
* **My.Diario (In planning, Flutter/Dart):** An app to manage grades, homework, tasks and deadlines, designed to simplify students' lives.
